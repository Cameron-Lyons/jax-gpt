    Returns list of utf-8 byte and a corresponding list of unicode strings.
    The reversible bpe codes work on unicode strings.
    This means you need a large # of unicode characters in your vocab if you want to avoid UNKs.
    When you're at something like a 10B token dataset you end up needing around 5K for decent coverage.
    This is a significant percentage of your normal, say, 32K bpe vocab.
    To avoid that, we want lookup tables between utf-8 bytes and unicode strings.
    And avoids mapping to whitespace/control characters the bpe code barfs on.
